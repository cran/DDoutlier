\title{Connectivity-based Outlier Factor (COF) algorithm}
\description{Function to calculate the connectivity-based outlier factor as an outlier score for observations. Suggested by Tang, J., Chen, Z., Fu, A. W. C., & Cheung, D. W. (2002)}
\usage{
COF(dataset, k = 5)
}
\arguments{
  \item{dataset}{The dataset for which observations have a COF score returned}
  \item{k}{The number of k-nearest neighbors to construct a SBN-path with, being the number of neighbors for each observation to compare chaining-distance with. k has to be smaller than the number of observations in dataset}
}
\details{COF computes the connectivity-based outlier factor for observations, being the comparison of chaining-distances between observation subject to outlier scoring and neighboring observations.
The COF function is useful for outlier detection in clustering and other multidimensional domains.}
\value{A vector of COF scores for observations. The greater the COF, the greater outlierness}
