\title{Natural Outlier Factor (NOF) algorithm}
\description{Function to calculate the Natural Outlier Factor (NOF) as an outlier score for observations. Suggested by Huang, J., Zhu, Q., Yang, L. & Feng, J. (2015)}
\usage{
NOF(dataset)
}
\arguments{
  \item{dataset}{The dataset for which observations have a NOF score returned}
}
\details{NOF computes the nearest and reverse nearest neighborhood for observations, based on the natural neighborhood algorithm. Density is compared between observations and their neighbors. A kd-tree is used for kNN computation, using the kNN() function from the 'dbscan' package}
\value{
\item{nb}{A vector of in-degrees for observations}
\item{max_nb}{Maximum in-degree observations in nb vector. Used as k-parameter in outlier detection of NOF}
\item{r}{The natural neighbor eigenvalue}
\item{NOF}{A vector of Natural Outlier Factor scores. The greater the NOF, the greater the outlierness}
