\title{Local Outlier Probability (LOOP) algorithm}
\description{Function to calculate the Local Outlier Probability (LOOP) as an outlier score for observations. Suggested by Kriegel, H.-P., Kröger, P., Schubert, E., & Zimek, A. (2009)}
\usage{
LOOP(dataset, k = 5, lambda = 3)
}
\arguments{
  \item{dataset}{The dataset for which observations have a LOOP score returned}
  \item{k}{The number of k-nearest neighbors to compare density with}
  \item{lambda}{Multiplication factor for standard deviation. The greater lambda, the smoother results. Default is 3 as used in original papers experiments}
}
\details{LOOP computes a local density based on probabilistic set distance for observations, with a user-given k-nearest neighbors. The density is compared to the density of the respective nearest neighbors, resulting in the local outlier probability. The values ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 being the greatest outlierness.
A kd-tree is used for kNN computation, using the kNN() function from the 'dbscan' package. The LOOP function is useful for outlier detection in clustering and other multidimensional domains}
\value{A vector of LOOP scores for observations. 1 indicates outlierness and 0 indicate inlierness
